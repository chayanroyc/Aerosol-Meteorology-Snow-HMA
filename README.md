# HMA-Snow-Aerosol-Interactions - Ancilliary Information

This repository contains the auxiliary data associated with the preprint **"Diagnosing Aerosol-Meteorological Interactions on Snow within the Earth System: A Proof-of-Concept Study over High Mountain Asia"** (EGU 2024, DOI: [10.5194/egusphere-2024-2298](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-2298/)).

## Overview

This study aims to understand the complexity of Earth's climate by proposing a novel, cost-effective approach to understand the web of interactions driving climate change. We focus on how pollution and weather processes interact and drive snowmelt in Asian glaciers. Our findings reveal significant yet overlooked processes across different climate models. Our approach can help in refining the development of these models for more reliable predictions in climate-vulnerable regions.

The repository contains all necessary links to the methods and datasets used in the study.
