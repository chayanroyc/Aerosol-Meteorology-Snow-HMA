# HMA-Snow-Aerosol-Interactions - Auxiliary Data Repository

This repository contains the auxiliary data associated with the preprint **"Diagnosing Aerosol-Meteorological Interactions on Snow within the Earth System: A Proof-of-Concept Study over High Mountain Asia"** (EGU 2024, DOI: [10.5194/egusphere-2024-2298](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-2298/)).

## Overview

The study investigates the interactions between aerosols, meteorology, and snow processes in the High Mountain Asia (HMA) region. It aims to explore aerosol-induced impacts on snow and the broader implications for regional climate and environmental health.

The repository contains all necessary auxiliary data used in the study, which includes the results from various simulations, observational data, and model outputs required for reproducing the findings of the paper.

## Data Description

The following data is available in this repository:

- **WRF-Chem Simulations**: Black carbon (BC) concentrations, aerosol species, and meteorological variables for the High Mountain Asia region.
- **Snowmelt Model Outputs**: Simulation outputs for snowmelt processes driven by aerosol and meteorological parameters.
- **Observational Data**: Ground-based and satellite data for aerosol and snow measurements from the study sites.
- **Modeling Code**: Python and/or other modeling scripts used for data analysis and simulation setup.
